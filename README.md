# 🏠 StayBackend: The Airbnb Clone Project

StayBackend is a **backend system** inspired by Airbnb, designed to handle property listings, bookings, user authentication, and reviews through a secure RESTful API.  
Built with **Django REST Framework** and **MySQL**, this project demonstrates real-world backend architecture, database design, API security, and CI/CD integration.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

The goal of StayBackend is to simulate the backend infrastructure of a platform like Airbnb — focusing on **data relationships**, **API security**, and **deployment workflows**.  
Users can:
- Register and log in (guest or host)
- Create and manage property listings
- Book stays and view reservations
- Leave reviews for listings

This project emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and security — essential traits of a production-grade application.

## 🧰 Technology Stack

The StayBackend project leverages modern, reliable, and scalable technologies to build a robust backend system.

- **Django:** A high-level Python framework for building secure and maintainable web applications. Handles backend logic and database integration.  
- **Django REST Framework (DRF):** Extends Django to create RESTful APIs efficiently.  
- **MySQL:** Relational database to store users, listings, bookings, reviews, and payments.  
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens):** Provides secure authentication and authorization.  
- **Docker:** Containerizes the application for consistent environments.  
- **GitHub & GitHub Actions:** For version control, CI/CD automation, and collaboration.  
- **GraphQL (Optional):** Optimizes data fetching by allowing clients to request only needed data.  
- **Postman:** Used for API testing and validation.  
- **Docker Compose:** Orchestrates multiple services into a unified environment.  
- **Markdown:** Maintains readable documentation for contributors and reviewers.

## 🗃️ Database Design

The database supports core functionalities like user management, property listings, bookings, and payments.

### **Entities and Fields**

#### Users
- `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`, `role`  
**Relationships:** Can have multiple properties and bookings.

#### Properties
- `id`, `title`, `description`, `price_per_night`, `host_id`  
**Relationships:** Belongs to a user (host) and can have many bookings and reviews.

#### Bookings
- `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `check_in`, `check_out`  
**Relationships:** Belongs to one user and one property.

#### Reviews
- `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`  
**Relationships:** Users can write multiple reviews; properties can receive multiple reviews.

#### Payments
- `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_status`, `payment_date`  
**Relationships:** Each payment is linked to a single booking.
