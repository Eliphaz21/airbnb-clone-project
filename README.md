## 🧰 Technology Stack

The StayBackend project leverages a combination of modern, reliable, and scalable technologies to build a robust backend system for the Airbnb Clone.  
Each technology plays a specific role in ensuring performance, security, and maintainability.

### 🐍 Django
**Purpose:** Django is a high-level Python web framework used to build secure, scalable, and maintainable web applications.  
In this project, it powers the backend by managing routes, handling requests/responses, and integrating with the database through its ORM (Object-Relational Mapper).

### 🧱 Django REST Framework (DRF)
**Purpose:** DRF extends Django to create RESTful APIs efficiently.  
It allows structured serialization of data, clean API endpoint creation, and strong authentication/permission handling for secure client-server communication.

### 🗄️ MySQL
**Purpose:** MySQL is the relational database used to store user data, listings, bookings, and reviews.  
It supports efficient queries, data normalization, and secure transactions between backend services.

### 🔐 JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
**Purpose:** JWT handles authentication and authorization.  
It ensures secure communication between the frontend and backend by verifying user identity during API requests.

### 🐳 Docker
**Purpose:** Docker containerizes the application to ensure consistent environments across development and production.  
It simplifies deployment, dependency management, and scalability through lightweight, isolated containers.

### ⚙️ GitHub & GitHub Actions
**Purpose:** GitHub hosts the codebase and enables team collaboration through version control.  
GitHub Actions automates continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD), running tests and deployments automatically after each commit.

### 🚀 GraphQL (Optional Integration)
**Purpose:** GraphQL provides a flexible alternative to REST APIs.  
It allows clients to request only the data they need, improving performance and reducing bandwidth usage.  
It’s useful for optimizing data flow in complex queries, such as filtering listings or fetching nested booking details.

### 🧪 Postman
**Purpose:** Postman is used for testing and validating API endpoints.  
It helps developers simulate requests, debug responses, and verify authentication workflows during development.

### 🧱 Docker Compose
**Purpose:** Docker Compose orchestrates multiple containers—like the Django backend, MySQL database, and testing services—into a unified environment.  
It simplifies the startup process using a single configuration file.

### 📜 Markdown
**Purpose:** Markdown is used to document the project (e.g., README.md).  
It helps maintain clean, readable documentation for contributors and reviewers.

---

> 🧭 **Summary:**  
> Together, these technologies form a modern backend architecture capable of supporting scalable booking systems, secure user authentication, and automated CI/CD pipelines for deployment.

🧩 Feature Breakdown

The StayBackend project includes core features that simulate a real-world Airbnb platform. Each feature is designed to enhance usability, security, and functionality.

👤 User Management

Allows users to register, log in, and manage their profiles.
Supports different roles such as guest and host, enabling access control and role-specific features throughout the application.
This ensures that users interact with the system securely and according to their responsibilities.

🏠 Property Management

Hosts can create, update, and delete property listings, including details such as title, description, price, and location.
Guests can browse available listings and view detailed information for each property.
This feature forms the backbone of the platform, enabling users to list and find accommodations.

📅 Booking System

Allows guests to book available properties and manage reservations.
Hosts can view bookings for their listings to track occupancy and availability.
This feature handles critical workflows like date validation, booking conflicts, and reservation management.

⭐ Review System

Guests can submit reviews and ratings for properties they’ve stayed in.
Hosts and other guests can view these reviews to assess property quality.
This feature fosters trust and transparency, enhancing the overall user experience.

💳 Payment System (Simulated)

Handles payment tracking for each booking, including amount, status, and timestamp.
Ensures that bookings are linked to a corresponding payment record.
Even in a simulated environment, this feature demonstrates secure transaction handling in a real-world booking system.

🔐 Security Features

Includes JWT authentication, input validation, and access controls for sensitive endpoints.
Ensures that only authorized users can perform actions such as editing listings or making bookings.
This feature safeguards user data and maintains the integrity of the platform.
---------------------------------------
🔐 API Security

Securing backend APIs is crucial to protect sensitive user data, maintain the integrity of bookings, and ensure that only authorized actions are performed. The StayBackend project implements multiple security measures to safeguard the system.

🧑‍💻 Authentication

JWT (JSON Web Tokens) is used to authenticate users securely.
Each user receives a unique token after login, which must be included in API requests to access protected endpoints.
Importance: Prevents unauthorized access to personal data and ensures that only valid users can perform actions such as booking properties or updating listings.

🔑 Authorization

Role-based access controls differentiate guests and hosts, limiting actions based on user roles.
For example, only hosts can create or modify property listings, while guests can make bookings and leave reviews.
Importance: Protects the system from misuse and ensures users can only perform actions permitted for their role.

🛡️ Rate Limiting

Limits the number of API requests a user or IP can make within a specific timeframe.
Helps prevent brute-force attacks, spam, and excessive load on the server.
Importance: Maintains server stability and reduces the risk of automated attacks.

🔍 Input Validation

All API inputs are validated using serializers to prevent invalid or malicious data from being stored in the database.
Importance: Protects against injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection) and ensures data consistency.

🧾 Secure Payment Handling

While payment processing is simulated, endpoints for payment data are protected by authentication and authorization.
Sensitive data, such as amounts and transaction statuses, are never exposed without proper verification.
Importance: Safeguards user financial information and maintains trust in the booking system.

🌐 CORS and HTTPS

Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies restrict which domains can interact with the API.
In production, HTTPS is used to encrypt all data in transit.
Importance: Protects against unauthorized third-party access and ensures data integrity during transmission.

----------------------------------------------------------------
⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline

A CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Deployment) pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying code changes.
It ensures that updates are delivered quickly, reliably, and safely, reducing the chance of human error and improving overall code quality.

🔹 Continuous Integration (CI)

Continuous Integration involves automatically building and testing the application whenever changes are pushed to the repository.
This ensures that new code does not break existing functionality and that the application remains stable throughout development.

🔹 Continuous Deployment (CD)

Continuous Deployment automates the deployment of successfully tested code to staging or production environments.
It ensures that new features and fixes reach users faster without manual intervention, maintaining a reliable workflow.

🔹 Tools Used in StayBackend

GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment whenever code is pushed or merged.

Docker: Containerizes the application and its dependencies to ensure consistency across environments.

Docker Compose: Orchestrates multiple services (e.g., Django backend, MySQL database) for easy local and production setups.

💡 Importance for StayBackend

Automates repetitive tasks like testing and deployment.

Ensures consistent application behavior across different environments.

Reduces human error and improves collaboration among team members.

Allows faster feedback loops and quicker release of new features.
