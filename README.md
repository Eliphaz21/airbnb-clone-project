# 🏠 StayBackend: The Airbnb Clone Project

StayBackend is a **backend system** inspired by Airbnb. It’s designed to handle property listings, bookings, user authentication, and reviews through a secure RESTful API.  
Built with **Django REST Framework** and **MySQL**, this project demonstrates real-world backend architecture, database design, and CI/CD integration.

---

## 🌍 Project Overview

The goal of StayBackend is to simulate the backend infrastructure of a platform like Airbnb — focusing on **data relationships**, **API security**, and **deployment workflows**.  
Users can:
- Register and log in (guest or host)
- Create and manage property listings
- Book stays and view reservations
- Leave reviews for listings

This project emphasizes scalability, maintainability, and security — essential traits of a production-grade application.
